In an hour, the same call to prayer will be heard again. Thanks, in large part, to social media, the moments in between have taken on new significance. Once a quiet period of anticipation, it now spills out onto the streets surrounding the mosque. For many, the morning congregation is no longer just a sacred moment of worship followed by a quick departure. It has evolved into a display of togetherness, as many meet up with those within their communities and show off their best Eid style."

In the nearly two years since, Bieber has embraced a litany of other purses, from top handles to shoulder bags, though it seems that she’s firmly back on team oversized clutch."
